A visual representation of cricket scores from FAC cricket to practice manipulating the DOM with vanilla javascript and layouts with vanilla CSS in the form of an Honours Board.

## Honours Board
A board found in the clubhouse of most cricket clubs which contains a list of the best scores acheived at that ground. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_honours_boards. Players can usually get onto the honours board by scoring over 100 runs, however in FAC cricket the required score to get your name immortalised in history is 10.

## Layout
I'd like to have a one page webapp with a table containing the list of names and scores on one side and some kind of analysis or graph on the other side of the page. The table should have three columns, name, score and date.
